##Getting Started


##Running and Testing Locally

The Food Bank app has a mock data service that lets you test without connecting to Force.com.
There is an alternate home page, as well as a Jasmine Test Runner page.  For example, on a Mac:

 # Open a Terminal window to the food bank application root and type the following:
     cd resource-bundles/Angular.resource
     python -m SimpleHTTPServer
 # For the home page, open your web browser to: http://localhost:8000/
 # For the test runner, open to: http://localhost:8000/test/TestRunner.html
